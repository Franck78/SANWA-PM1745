This is a redraw of the actual ugly & only schematic for the SANWA PM1745


It was made from two boards and the old schematic.

IC103
  can be two single optocouplers
  PC817
  or a dual
  TLR621-2

POWER Supply
  One board has the PS dead.
  The other one seems functionning.
  Without the EHT, I took some measurement
  but I'm absolutly unsure of them.
  NEED from a functionnal board, at least
  the B+ and the 12P
  
ZENER
  Need real measures for all of them
  D103
  D106
  D804
  
  
FACTORY BODGES

  D305 & D305
    under the LA7832
    Old schematics says 1SS83, probaly FR104 can do.

  R899
    Before the base of Q804, a 82 ohms resistor (1/8) is added on only
    one of my two boards.
    The trace is open with mask during pcb manufacturing. So, not visible 
    cutter/tool ! But as for the diodes, they didn't do a real pcb revision.
  

CONNECTOR 176300-1
  This is the wiring I have on my two boards.
  The old schematic says otherwise

I reverse engineered the two SMD modules.

BX6341 (15 pins) does the black level stuff

BX6341 (12 pins)

This one is strange because what is supposed to be H & V inputs (pins 2, 8)
are outputs.

R9,R10,R11 form some loop so mesure is not good, need thinking !

Partlist
  found the source of the crappy schematic! Here, page 120 + Partlist (123) and procedures

B+ adjustment sans signal  (page 152 Sega Touring)

   fh ON CN503    76v (15Khz)
   fh ON CN504   119v (24Khz)


Send remarks please.
